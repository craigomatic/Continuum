C# implementation of the Continuum v2 specification.

Continuum is a binary file format designed to capture changes in state. It supports forward and backwards playback and random seek and is designed to be streamed over a network.

The Continuum file format is useful in industries such as virtual worlds, stock markets, online auctions or any other area where being able to capture and then playback something that occurred for analysis is useful.
